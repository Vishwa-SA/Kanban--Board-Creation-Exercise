# Kanban Workflow Training Activity

This repository provides a step-by-step group activity to help teams understand Kanban principles and visualize their workflows.

## 🔄 Activity Overview

### Step 1: Choose a Workflow (5 min)
Each group selects a real-world process to visualize, such as:
- Software development
- HR hiring pipeline
- Marketing campaign
- Customer support
- Daily personal tasks

### Step 2: Design the Kanban Board (15–20 min)
Use sticky notes, whiteboards, or Miro/Mural to build a Kanban board with:

✅ Columns: Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Review → Done  
✅ Swimlanes (Optional): e.g., Features, Bugs, Teams  
✅ Card Types: Use color/shape coding for different item types  
✅ WIP Limits: Add for critical columns like “In Progress”  
✅ Explicit Policies: Define entry/exit rules (e.g., code must be peer-reviewed)  
✅ Blockers & Queues: Mark blocked tasks and define waiting queues
